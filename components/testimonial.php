                    <p class="t-color-black text-center px-md-5 px-2 t-sm font-w-500"> My son Arick sagar is studying at vidya sagar since Playgroup and currently in Nursery, He is a US citizen and we relocated to india, after making thorough searching and comparing the schools in India and US, and what caught our attention is VSP practices ‘Emphasizing on the morals and ethical conditioning of children’. Given the history, the school has been ranked in top 10 several times for the annual Education World India and continues to maintain it. The school is known for having the best competence of teachers, structured curriculum, parental involvement, and individual attention to students. The school provides a smooth transition to children and parents to enter to the educational world by welcoming the kids with warmth and acknowledging them, by setting friendly ambience and is also recognized for their child-centric culture and environment, which helps develop various essential skill sets in instilling confidence in young children to perform excellently.</p>

I just love the holistic method that the school follows to nurture such young minds. I’m extremely happy to see my child being so bold word. public speaking skills. The teachers are very talented, professional and humble. I love the way how every festival is celebrated and how the meaning of the same is conveyed to the child. Be it any activity like Sports day, Kalasagar, gyaan sagar or Kavya Vachan, everything is done so perfectly to bring out each child’s interest. This is definitely one of the best and finest preschool in Bangalore.
